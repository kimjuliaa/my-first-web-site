<p style="margin-top:25px;"><strong>BLACKPINK</strong> consists of members Jennie, Jisoo, Ros√© and Lisa.<br>The group formed after auditioning for agency YG Entertainment's K-pop trainee program in South Korea, and debuted in August 2016 with 'Square One.' 
The K-pop group released multiple single albums and EPs in the coming years, with 2018's 'SQUARE UP' EP breaking into the all-genre tally at No. 40. 
Debut studio album 'The Album' arrived in October 2020 and peaked at No. 2, while sophomore set 'Born Pink' debuted at No. 1 in October 2022, making them the first K-pop girl group to top the chart. 
BLACKPINK arrived on the Hot 100 with 2018's "DDU-DU DDU-DU" (off 'Square Up') at No. 55.
Since finding global stardom, the quartet has made history with its achievements, among them being the first female K-pop artists on a Billboard magazine cover, becoming the first K-pop girl group recognized by the RIAA, the first female K-pop group to win a VMA, and being the first Asian act to headline Coachella in 2023.
